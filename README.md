# Deep-Learning
# Deep Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of deep learning projects exploring various applications and techniques. Each project is organized into a dedicated folder with its own detailed README file, datasets, and implementation.

## Projects Included

1. Food Image Classification (Food-101 Dataset):
   - A project to classify food images into 101 categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and PyTorch.
   - [Details in the project folder](Food-Image-Classification)

2. Image Segmentation Project:
   -A project to annotate and segment images using deep leaning tools.
   
## Key Objectives

- Explore the use of deep learning models for solving diverse real-world problems.
- Experiment with various neural network architectures, optimizers, and techniques.
- Provide structured code, detailed documentation, and reproducible results for each project.
